# Project Description
The Real Estate Project is a testing suite built to validate the functionality of a real estate web application. This project demonstrates my expertise in automated testing using Cypress and JavaScript, with a focus on two distinct approaches: Cypress API for browser-based testing and Axios for standalone API testing. By separating these tools, I showcase my ability to test both the frontend user experience and backend API interactions independently, ensuring a robust and reliable application.
This project is the first in my tester portfolio, highlighting my skills in writing modular tests, handling HTTP requests, and ensuring quality across different layers of a web application.
