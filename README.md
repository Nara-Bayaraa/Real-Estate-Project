# 🖥️  Project Description
The Real Estate Project is a testing suite built to validate the functionality of a real estate web application. This project demonstrates my expertise in automated testing using Cypress and JavaScript, with a focus on two distinct approaches: Cypress API for browser-based testing and Axios for standalone API testing. By separating these tools, I showcase my ability to test both the frontend user experience and backend API interactions independently, ensuring a robust and reliable application.
This project is the first in my tester portfolio, highlighting my skills in writing modular tests, handling HTTP requests, and ensuring quality across different layers of a web application.

# ⚙️ Features

- Cypress API Testing: End-to-end and integration tests for user flows like property browsing and form submissions, leveraging Cypress’s built-in API capabilities.
- Frontend Validation: Browser-based tests to ensure UI elements and interactions work as expected.
- Backend Validation: Independent API checks to confirm data consistency and server reliability.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Cypress: For UI and API testing.
- JavaScript: Core language for scripting tests and logic.
- Node.js: Runtime environment for executing the tests.
- Design Pattern: Page Object Model.
- Test Report: Mochawesome.
