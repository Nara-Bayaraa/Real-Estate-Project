# 🏠 Real Estate Project – Cypress Automated Testing Suite

## 🖥️ Project Description

The Real Estate Project is an automated testing suite designed to ensure the quality and reliability of a real estate web application.
It demonstrates expertise in both **UI (browser-based) and API (backend)** testing using Cypress and JavaScript.

By separating UI and API tests, this project showcases the ability to validate both the frontend user experience and backend data integrity.
All tests are modular, using the **Page Object Model (POM)** for maintainable and scalable test automation.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* **Cypress E2E UI Testing:**
  Automated, browser-based user flows for login, property listings, dashboard, registration, etc.
* **API Testing:**
  Standalone backend validation (CRUD for listings, users, search, etc.) using Cypress’s built-in API commands.
* **Modular Page Objects:**
  Reusable selectors and methods to keep UI tests DRY and organized.
* **Parallel Test Execution:**
  Run tests in parallel using `cypress-parallel` for fast feedback and scalable pipelines.
* **Automated Reporting:**
  Rich HTML test reports generated with Mochawesome.
* **GitHub Actions CI/CD:**
  Modern pipeline support with parallel execution and dependency caching.

## 🕒 Automated CI Schedule

```bash
schedule:
    - cron: '0 11 * * *'   #run every day at  5:00 AM Chicago time (CST)
```

- **Nightly runs:**  
  This project’s test suite is **automatically triggered every day at 5:00 AM Chicago time (CST)** via a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow.

- **Configuration:**  
  The schedule is managed using this [cron expression](https://crontab.guru/#0_11_*_*_*):

- **Purpose:**  
Purpose:
Automatically checks test health and coverage daily, so you don’t have to run tests manually.
All test results and reports are generated and can be accessed in the GitHub Actions workflow logs and artifacts.
